### Datapane
# Hello World
Initial exploration of Datapane, a Python framework for building dashboards. Inspired by Khuyen Tran's excellent [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/datapanes-new-features-create-a-beautiful-dashboard-in-python-in-a-few-lines-of-code-a3c44523292b) on Datapane. 

I used Datapane's suggested starter code to create a covid dashboard. I customized for three selected countries. 
- United Arab Emirates
- United Kingdom
- United States 

I consulted Leo Anthias's repo for guidance on [adjusting](https://github.com/datapane/gallery/blob/master/hello-world/hello_world.ipynb) Datapane's starter code. 

While working in jupyter notebook, you can preview the results of your chart.

Creating and previewing a report can be done in a few lines of code, and publishing to Datapane is accomplished in a single line.
